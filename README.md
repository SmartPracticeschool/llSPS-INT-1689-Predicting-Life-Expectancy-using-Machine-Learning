Predicting Life Expectancy using Machine Learning


Predicting Life Expectancy using Machine Learning.


Project Summary -  
Prediction of life expectancy is difficult for humans. Our research shows that machine learning and natural language processing techniques offer a feasible and promising approach to predicting life expectancy. The research has potential for real-life applications, such as supporting timely recognition of the right moment to start Advance Care Planning. 


Functional requirements –
Life expectancy is a statistical measure of the average time a human being is expected to live, Life expectancy depends on various factors: Regional variations, Economic Circumstances, Sex Differences, Mental Illnesses, Physical Illnesses, Education, Year of their birth and other demographic factors. This problem statement provides a way to predict average life expectancy of people living in a country when various factors such as year, GDP, education, alcohol intake of people in the country, expenditure on healthcare system and some specific disease related deaths that happened in the country are given the dataset.
•	Predict life expectancy with maximum accuracy .
•	Process the dataset and find dependent and independent variables relationship.

 
Technical  requirements  -
Technical requirements for Predicting Life Expectancy using Machine Learning as following –
•	Use python as base language.
•	Use IBM watson studio for data processing .
•	Use IBM Node-RED for flow-based development using  visual programming .


Software Requirements –

Predicting Life Expectancy using Machine Learning is based on the supervised machine learning using linear regression algorithm. we need following software to develop  the project –
•	IDE(Integrated development environment Software) for write the python code  .
•	Database software to stone the dataset of the project .
•	Communication software to communicate with the team members and discuss the problem and future planes of the project .

Project Deliverables – 

Predicting Life Expectancy using Machine Learning deliver the outcome for the given  dataset of any county. It will predict the life expectancy based on  the –
•	'Country',
•	 'Year',
•	 'Status'
•	 'Life expectancy '
•	 'Adult Mortality'
•	 'infant deaths'
•	'Alcohol'
•	'percentage expenditure'
•	'Hepatitis B'
•	'Measles ' 
•	' BMI '
•	'under-five deaths ' 
•	'Polio'
•	'Total expenditure'
•	'Diphtheria '
•	' HIV/AIDS' 
•	'GDP'
•	'Population'
•	' thinness  1-19 years' 
•	' thinness 5-9 years'
•	'Income composition of resources' 
•	'Schooling'

Project Team –

1.	TEJAS K N       -- Project manager and developer
2.	TheSmartBridge   -- Project sponser .

Project Schedule –
Predicting Life Expectancy using Machine Learning project will be develop completely  with maximum accuracy with in given dead line which is 30 days ( 15 may to 15 june ).
